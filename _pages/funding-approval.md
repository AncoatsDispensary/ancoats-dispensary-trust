### PURCELL APPOINTED AS ARCHITECTS 

Crowdfunding began as we journeyed towards Stage One in our mission to safeguard the Dispensary.  Assisted by a Crowdfunding organisation, a member of the group with research skills developed a Crowdfunding strategy.  This ran alongside the fundraising events organised by the group itself.  In order to achieve Stage One funding, the group had to ‘match-fund’ whatever the Heritage Lottery Fund awarded.  This was a considerable amount, but the group were helped by generous donations from the public, as well as a large donation from Great Places Housing Trust.  

The Crowdfunding began in November 2014 and continued up until May 2015, the date when the match-funding had to be raised otherwise Stage One would not be able to proceed. In the meantime, the group felt that rather than submit the application for Stage One and then wait for a decision that turn out to be unfavourable, we should celebrate and hold an event to share with the public our successes up to this point.   

The procurement process was moving forward and Purcell Architects were commissioned as the Architects and Heritage Consultants, in the event that we were successful at Stage One.  Purcell had an excellent reputation and wanted to become involved in the Dispensary having understood complicitly the importance the building held, not only for Ancoats, but for Manchester itself.

One of the architects produced a poster to promote the event we agreed to hold at Halle St Peters entitled, *Share the Vision*.  The event was held in February 2014 and was a great success.  The event was attended by our two Patrons, John Henshaw and June Rosen; the Bishop of Manchester; the son of John Pickstone (founder of Manchester Histories); the Head of RIBA – Royal Institute of British Architects; Igloo, our development partners; and various other guests from a host of organisations. Music was played by musicians from RNCM and a Chinese Dragon Dance featured to ensure the inclusion of the Chinese community who had expressed an interest in supporting the Dispensary campaign.  Singing was also provided by the Golden Voices Community Choir and refreshments were served.  A painting of the Dispensary by the artist Julian Bovis was auctioned at the event and raised £600.



### MARCH 2014 – REJECTED BY HERITAGE LOTTERY NORTH WEST 

Although this was a blow, we were determined not to be daunted. We re-submitted the application with some minor adjustments and in, July 2014, the decision came back that this time we had been successful. In order to proceed, however, the match-funding still had to be raised to match the funding awarded for Stage One. Unfortunately, even with the various fundraising events held by the group, including the Crowdfunding being carried out, a shortfall remained of £28,000.  

### MAY 2015 – LAST MINUTE DONATION

In May 2015, in the final hour, the Ancoats Dispensary Trust received an anonymous donation for this precise amount. meaning that Stage One was able to proceed and Purcell were formally appointed.  Business Plan preparations began in earnest.
