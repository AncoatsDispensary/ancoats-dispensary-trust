**‘To promote the conservation and restoration of Ancoats Dispensary for the benefit of the communities now living in the Ancoats neighbourhood. This includes the wider economic, social and cultural regeneration of Manchester.’**
{: .text-center}

The Industrial Revolution had to begin in a specific place and that place was Manchester- more specifically, Ancoats.  The history of Ancoats, and in particular Ancoats Dispensary, does not belong only to Manchester. It belongs as a global heritage treasure; it belongs to the world.  

The saving and restoration of Ancoats Dispensary aimed not only give the area a historical context, but also to add a depth and richness to the new communities arriving in the neighbourhood.  It would have connected with those whose roots are buried deep in an area bursting at the seams with memories.  No site in Manchester, and very few sites in Britain, epitomise the historic interplay of medicine, social history and community action better than Ancoats Dispensary.
