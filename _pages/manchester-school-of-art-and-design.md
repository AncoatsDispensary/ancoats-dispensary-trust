In 2013, a young group of film-makers (Bad Bug) asked us if they could be of any help?  We asked them to take part in a project with the **Manchester School of Art & Design** who were also interested in supporting the Ancoats Dispensary Trust.

The students were asked to work on conceptual ideas for the Dispensary, bearing in mind the elements of sustainability and employment
