Every so often a celebration and a gathering of the group and anyone from the community met up at the Vigil and enjoyed not only eating one of Andy's burgers but also found out about the latest news about the campaign. The Burger Nights were advertised well in advance on social media as well as at The Vigil so that despite the weather at least 30 people attended. Very often people would make a donation at this event.
