The group made connections with other Heritage organisations in Manchester to not only promote the Ancoats Dispensary but also to begin to build a network of expertise.

**The Manchester Victorian Society** was one of our very first supporters and helped us enormously to make the journey towards saving a listed building.  We received many donations from individual members of the Society who were extremely generous.  

**Victoria Baths** - invited us several times to have a presence at their regular Heritage Days.

At all these events people were able to purchase merchandise that had been created by artists who had donated their work.  Images of the Dispensary were printed on linen shopping bags, tea towels and mugs.  This was an important part of our fundraising efforts.
