## A History of Fundraising in Ancoats

By the time the National Health Service was founded in 1948, Ancoats Dispensary had been providing medical care for the people of Ancoats for 120 years. Fundraising was a major part of hospital life. In wealthy areas, residents paid subscriptions to their local hospitals and dispensaries, or paid for the treatment they received. In industrial Ancoats, very few people could afford to commit to annual subscriptions to pay for the running of the Dispensary, or even for their own treatment. The largest subscribers were the churches and manufacturers within Ancoats, and it was on them that the poor depended to pay for their medical care. Ancoats Dispensary depended on wealthy benefactors and patrons for its expansion. 

Built in 1828 to dispense medicines and advice to out-patients, the Dispensary soon required wards for in-patients. It was large donations from a number of prosperous local people that paid for the building and maintenance of these hospital wards. These charitable acts not only assisted the Dispensary, but cemented the power and prestige of those individuals within the community. 

Frederick Cawley and James Jardine were among the many powerful people who gave money to the Ancoats Dispensary. Hannah Brackenbury was another vital donor. The current Dispensary building, at 24-28 Mill Street, was largely funded by her. She bequeathed £5,000 to pay for the new building, with another £,2000 set aside for ‘establishment charges’. One of the wards was named the Brackenbury Ward in her honour. 

Ancoats had a vibrant fundraising culture, and the poorer people of the community contributed where they could. Collection boxes were placed in churches and in workshops and factories. Groups of residents went house-to-house to collect donations, and the Workpeople’s Fund Committee organised walks, dances and football competitions to raise money. 

In order to become a patient of Ancoats Dispensary, the poor needed to find somebody to recommend them. Individuals who made annual donations were entitled to recommend a certain number of patients each year. The owners of mills and other workplaces subscribed to dispensaries in order to secure healthcare for their employees. This practice was more than a benevolent gesture - employers could use recommendations to exact compliance from their workers. An extract from writings of one of the doctors at the Dispensary, _“Many absolutely die without having had any medical assistance. That this is frequently the case in the district of Ardwick and Ancoats Dispensary is well known to myself and colleagues. It is… no uncommon occurrence for us to find that one, or even two children in a family have fallen victim to measles, scarlet fever, or some other epidemic disease, before a recommendation could be procured, though probably several hours during two or three days may have been spent in begging for one.”_

Daisy Day was an annual parade held to raise money for Ancoats Dispensary. Artificial daisies were sold in their thousands by flower girls throughout Manchester. There was also a parade, which set off from Market Street, and wound its way through the streets of Ancoats before ending at Belle Vue Gardens. The photograph above is from 1923 and shows children from Ancoats in fancy dress ready for the parade. “Greater Ancoats has done wonders to make the parade a success and it was fitting that its own people, rather than the more fashionable parts of the city, should see the show.” 

In the Summer of 2012, the Fight to Save the Dispensary campaign group began their own fundraising.  At the beginning of each Community Meeting people would donate whatever they could so that at least we could pay for basic materials such as paper and printer ink.  We were also able to pay for materials to make Questionnaire boxes.  Many people within the group donated not only their valuable time but helped to fund refreshments at the vigil.  

## HLF Funding Applied For 

In July 2013 We applied to the Heritage Lottery Fund for the North West so that we could begin to set up and develop a governance structure and pay the legal costs for setting up the Special Purpose Vehicle and to have the capacity of attending heritage events and courses and pay the fees for any professional advice that would eventually lead to applying for Stage One funding to safeguard the building.  The funding also enabled us to employ an Outreach Worker for 10 weeks so that they could engage with local community groups and promote the Dispensary as well as carrying out a Local Needs Assessments with community groups to discover what the community thought and felt about what the Dispensary should become.  The funding also paid for 3 members of Ancoats Dispensary Trust to attend the Locality Conference in Leicester – meet other organisations with similar aims and objectives and share ideas, what works, what doesn’t, and what are the pitfalls.

This was our first opportunity to engage with other heritage organisations throughout the country.  In this we were successful and in October 2013 we were awarded a £10,000 Start-Up Grant.
