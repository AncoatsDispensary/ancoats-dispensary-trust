The Story Behind *‘The Outpatients Hall’* Painting by LS Lowry

Among the many surgeons who practised their skills at the Ancoats Hospital was Peter McEvedy, a New Zealander.  Mr McEvedy was very well respected by all he came into contact with, patients and colleagues alike.  He was known for not only being a superb surgeon, but also for being someone who was always on the side of the ‘underdog’.  

Before the establishment of the NHS in 1948, the Lancashire Education Authority Committee paid the hospital £2991 per annum to carry out children’s  tonsillectomies.  As a result of the founding of the NHS, such funds were not required post-1948 and  there happened to be a surplus remaining of £1800.  It was decided to split this sum between the nine consultants at the hospital.  For whatever reason, Mr McEvedy -the senior surgeon at the time- declined his share.

Upon his sudden death in 1952, his colleagues were so shocked and saddened that they wanted to pay tribute to Mr McEvedy and decided to commission an artist to paint a painting of the Hospital in his honour.

The artist chosen was LS Lowry and he was paid the sum of £500.  Nurses we have interviewed remember Lowry sitting on one of the forms in the Outpatients Hall sketching in his sketch books.  He would take off his hat, place it by his side and begin his work.  No-one bothered him and he was left to ‘get on with it’.   

The painting was to become one of Lowry’s most famous works, *‘The Outpatients Hall’*, and is one of his few internal paintings.  The painting hung in the Committee Room at Ancoats Hospital until 1962, when the Graves Art Gallery in Sheffield asked if they could borrow it for a Lowry exhibition.  It was specially insured for £1000 for its trip to Sheffield.  In the 1980s, it was exhibited once more, this time at the Barbican in London and then after the hospital closed in the late 1980s, the Whitworth Art Gallery in Manchester held it in their archives for a number of years.  It was exhibited at Tate Britain in 2013 and is now held once again at the Whitworth in Manchester. 'The Outpatients Hall' can be seen by appointment.
