**Night of Art** was an Open Art Exhibition which was held at Halle St Michaels in 2014.  As well as being a fundraising event Night of Art was an opportunity for anyone in the community to showcase their art work.  Manchester City Football Club donated a signed shirt which was framed for the evening and was one of the raffle prizes.  Both Patrons attended and students from Manchester Metropolitan University volunteered to assist with refreshments.  The art exhibition provided an opportunity to send a message to the community that events like this would be part of a restored Dispensary.
