In September 2014 the Manchester Metropolitan University invited Ancoats Dispensary Trust to take part in a groundbreaking project.  

The University was, for the first time, inviting academics to partner a community group of their choice and explore the ways in which they could assist the group in whatever their aims and objectives were.  The project was entitled ‘Creating Our Future Histories’.  

Apart from the academics, one of our Patrons, June Rosen, also took part in the process whenever she could.  A student attending the MMU Creative Writing Course also attended as he felt he could contribute to the project.  Ultimately, the project continued through the Spring of 2015 with members of ADT meeting at week-ends at the Peoples History Museum where workshops with other groups took place.  The project resulted in an exhibition being held at Halle St Peters entitled ‘Creating Our Future Histories’.

The academics did all the research about Ancoats and the Dispensary and to promote and engage the public they produced a wonderful ‘blog’ for our website entitled **Ancoats in 100 Objects.**

It was during this period that Andy Hickmott, who was completing an MA in Creative Writing at Manchester Metropolitan University and studying poetry under the direction of the Poet Laureate, Carol Ann Duffy, offered to become our ‘Poet in Residence’.

Andy became so inspired by the story of the Dispensary that for one of his final pieces of work he wrote a book of poetry entitled in:dispensable.  The italic is not a mistake but the way Andy has named his book.  Andy had his book published and donated copies to ADT to sell at fundraising events.   These are a few of his final poems about the Dispensary with ‘Annie Coates’ as the building.

### The New Mrs Coates

(1874) 

No one remembers Annie’s maiden name
nor the street from which she wedded came,
though, for sure, folk there must’ve hung the same

grey saggy nets behind their peeling sashes,
with steps a man paints and his woman washes
(flaked and caked now as once were Annie’s)— 

streets in the shadows of smokestacks steaming,
streets you wouldn’t dream of being seen in
for fear of young fellows minded for scuttling;

streets that breathe like an asthmatic lung— 
coughing out spent flesh through distraught iron
gates, drawn back at next shift, and closing time.

No one remembers the fuss that was made
of her coming, the hoop-la proclamations said
then carved on a stone they set over her head.

### Fetch Mrs Coates!

(1915)

She arrives on a clatter of cobbles,
her coming announced by clank of chain,
by ominous knocking. She’s found us,
the one house down our street tonight
with a light on. Her pinioned black bag
fills us with jitters of hope and dread.

She nods to white flags flapping outside— 
women’s labour is everywhere screaming.
‘Gave him a royal send-off?’ she jokes.
‘I hope he’s quicker to pull on a gas mask.’
Sends the sister’s eldest to the standpipe,
tells the old woman to warm the stove.

She follows the screaming to the lying-in,
sets down her bag, clears the dresser
and lays out the ghastly accoutrements
of the delivery trade on a clean nappy :
forceps, cord clamps, a stethoscope;
sharp scissors lain on a steel kidney bowl.

She wets two fingers with spittle. Gasp!
‘The old tar's halfway out the porthole,’
she says to no one in particular, chuckling. 
Wax-paper is slid between buttocks
and soiled bedding, a few bloody snips,
two hours’ yelling, some desperate panting

and a new hand for Murray’s Mill is born.
‘Best name him after his dad,’ is said;
in case his dad nair comes home is not.
Annie says to bathe the mother, the bairn,
the bedding in that strict order. But not
till she’s washed her own hands and gone.

### Mrs Coates at War

(December, 1940)

In drizzly darkness she meets the warden,
coal-lit at his brazier. “All well, Mr Wareing?”
“Aye, but that were a close one—”
and on cue, a siren wails in the distance.
The sky above Baxindale’s convulses red
as the rock-roof of Satan’s cavern;
false dawns of Liverpool, Trafford, Salford;
across the firmament bright halos chase
after droning devil-silhouettes.
“Turning tail, them ones. Done their worst.”

Further along the towpath, ‘Dad’ Bailey,
lock-keeper and builder of air-raid shelters :
“Mr Bailey.” A short puff, and “Matron.”
Better a quiet smoke by the canal
than strung last moments in an empty bed
or night billeted under Union Street bridge
with the missus, the sandbags and the kids.
“Hold up, I’ll fetch a little summat—”
he comes back out with an orange
“—our Nancy queued a whole hour at Hollins
but won’t mind it’s you having it.”

They’re nose-to-tail along Old Mill Street
already rushing the wounded inside,
so Annie quickens her stride. An ARP warden
pulls the blackout curtain to one side
to let her and the stretcher bearers pass.
In A&E everyone except the dying— 
and Annie—is wearing their gas-mask.
She dumps her wet coat in the cloakroom.
“They’ve hit Piccadilly.” “Assizes is burning.”
Annie says nothing, grabs what she needs,
gives a small boy who’s crying the orange. 

### Mrs Coates in Retirement

(1989)

Sits and waits
forgets why— 

and what happened
to that new estate

they put up not long ago?
The Cardroom or whathaveyou— 

Did I dream all that?
I was a nurse once, you know— 

Where did all the children go?
We loaded them on trains,

sent them somewhere safe
fitted with parcel tags.

Where did they go?
When did they come home?

Why are there none
playing in the street outside?

Must be the Blitz,
she decides.

### Mrs Coates, Reborn

(2015)

Shrunken down to the shape and size
that she cut as a child,
her skin frail and crumbling,
only a scaffold kept her from tumbling— 

but Annie was loved by those she delivered
from wombs, from complicated births,
from stockyard-falls and boiler-bursts,
from faltering hearts and livers.

The grateful kept vigil while she slept,
petitioned the deity Urban Splash :
made sure Annie’s life support was kept
turned on with generous libations of cash.

Annie blinks out across the canal
and wonders how best to love us now.

### A Nurse Remembers

The group met Irene Bentley when she took part in a fundraising walk in Manchester.  We discovered that she had been a nurse at Ancoats Hospital before the establishment of the NHS in 1948. Irene had lots of memories of working at the Hospital and agreed to take part in a film that would become part of our 'Creating Our Future Histories Project'.  Irene was filmed in her own home and the film was shown at Halle St Peters in 2015.  Unfortunately, although Irene did attend the event, she wasn't feeling very well and didn't see the film.  However, her grandchildren and daughter were present and they did see it. Not long after this Irene had a fall from which she never recovered and this film is a tribute to her and all those who worked with her at Ancoats Hospital before the NHS. You will hear Irene mention LS Lowry who sketched his drawings in preparation for his famous painting 'The Outpatient’s Hall’. As Irene said, everyone was so busy and the nurses knew Lowry wasn't a patient so he just sat on one of the benches, placed his hat by his side and worked away with his drawings.
