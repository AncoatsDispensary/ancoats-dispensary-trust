June Rosen, Patron of ADT, alongside Dr Michael Whitfield, GP, and author of The Dispensaries: Healthcare for the Poor Before the NHS: Britainâ€™s Forgotten Health-care System Dispensaries: An Alternative to General Practice?

Ancoats Dispensary Trust has been very fortunate to be supported by many individuals and organisations throughout the campaign.  We were able to invite the general public to several events which included walks around the Ancoats, Ardwick, and city centre areas.  These walks were led by Mark Watson, a member of the Manchester Victorian Society, and Chris Makepeace, a well-known Manchester historian.
