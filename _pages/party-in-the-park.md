Our Secretary liaised with Manchester City Council to secure a place at the regular 'Party in the Park' events. These were held at both Phillips Park and Adactus Housing held a similar event in Miles Platting. It was at these events that banner-making, sale of home-made cakes, raffles and art workshops helped our fundraising efforts.
