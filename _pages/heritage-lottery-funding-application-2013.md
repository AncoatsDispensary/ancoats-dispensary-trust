**Heritage Lottery Funding Application 2013**

In July 2013 We applied for a ‘Start-Up Grant’ to the Heritage Lottery Fund North West.  This was to enable us to set up and develop a governance structure, pay the legal costs for setting up a funding vehicle and have the capacity to attend heritage events.  This would also help us to attend appropriate courses and pay the fees for any professional advice that would eventually lead to applying for Stage One funding to safeguard the building. 

The funding would also enable us to employ an Outreach Worker for 10 weeks so that they could engage with local community groups.  The purpose of this would be to promote the Dispensary, as well as carry out a Local Needs Assessment with community groups to discover what the community thought and felt about what the Dispensary should become. The funding would also pay   for 3 members of Ancoats Dispensary Trust to attend the Locality Conference in Leicester.  Meeting with other organisations with similar aims and objectives, sharing ideas, about what works, what doesn’t, and what are the pitfalls, were all going to be extremely helpful.  This would also be our first opportunity to engage with other heritage organisations throughout the country.  

We were successful in our application and in October 2013 were awarded a £10,000 Start-Up Grant.
